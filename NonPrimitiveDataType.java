 * Strings: it is a class
 * 
 * String name1 = "Ashish";
 * String name2 = "Ashish"; // executing these two lines, only one object is
 * created (there will be two references for both of these, but they will be
 * referencing same object): Java has something called "String Constant Pool",

 * Mutable String, Immutable String
 * 
 * StringBuffer: to implement mutable string (it is thread sage)
 * StringBuilder: everything is same as StringBuffer, except the thread safety
